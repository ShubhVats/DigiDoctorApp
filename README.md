<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

We will be developing an Application which will be a flutter Project so that, we could help each and
every people as well as doctors to keep themselves safe and process to get swift and easy from both
user ends. In this App, patient as well as doctors can create the account and can view their profile.
Patients can type their health issues and can send it to the respective doctor according to their choice.
After selecting the particular Doctor, patients can check their fees that means patients can have the prior
knowledge regarding the fees. When Doctors receive the texted health issues from patients, doctors can
prescribe them using the keyboard which could be sent directly to patients email I’d.

Here's why:
* Single Codebase to serve in android as well as iOS
* Patient and Doctor can create their own Private account
* Patient can select the type of Doctors (Specialization)
* Patient can type their health issues
* Doctors receive the texted health issues
* Patients could know the fees of doctors accordingly
* Doctors can prescribe the patient using keyboard
* Prescription to be mailed directly to patient.
* Shop for home Delivery
